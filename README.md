#  Project Description

This project demonstrates how to summarize long text passages using the **T5 transformer model** from Hugging Face's `transformers` library. The steps below explain the code and flow of the summarization process.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Import Required Classes**  
   The code begins by importing `T5Tokenizer` and `T5ForConditionalGeneration` from the `transformers` library, which are essential for working with the T5 model.

2. **Load Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer**  
   The `t5-base` model is selected. Both the tokenizer and model are loaded using Hugging Faceâ€™s pretrained models.

3. **Input Text**  
   A multi-paragraph article about Operation Sindhoor is provided as the input for summarization.

4. **Prepare Input for the Model**  
   The input is prefixed with `"summarize:"` so the T5 model understands that the task is summarization (since it is a text-to-text model).

5. **Tokenization**  
   The text is tokenized using the tokenizer, converting it into numerical IDs and truncating if it exceeds 512 tokens.

6. **Generate Summary**  
   The model uses beam search (`num_beams=4`) and a `length_penalty` of 2.0 to generate a high-quality summary with a maximum of 100 tokens.

7. **Decode and Print Summary**  
   The generated token IDs are decoded back into human-readable text and printed. Additionally, the word count of the summary is also displayed.

#  Summary:

This project uses the T5 transformer model to convert lengthy text into concise summaries. It walks through loading the pretrained model and tokenizer, preparing and tokenizing the input, and then generating and decoding the summary. With beam search and length penalties, the output is fine-tuned for readability and precision. The project showcases the practical use of LLMs for text summarization, highlighting how models like T5 can automate the reduction of long-form content while preserving essential information.
